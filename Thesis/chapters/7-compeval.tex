\chapter{Comparison and Evaluation}
\label{chp:compeval}

To prove that the criteria is properly calibrated and gives desired results, another set of architectures is evaluated.\\
These architectures were designed with the survey feedback in mind.
The test set architectures sometimes different immensely from each other to be able to better crystallize the criteria,
whereas these now are kept relatively similar to each other to ensure the criteria is not biased towards a specific architecture.\\
Similarly to the test set, this chapter will describe the architectures, estimate the desired results, and evaluate the architectures using the tool.
The following architectures all use the same building blocks with the same values as described in \ref{chp:arch}.

\section{Architecture A}
\label{sec:archa}

\nameref{fig:architectureA} features four entry points, and six interfaces which are relatively separated from the rest of the components 
meaning that the amount of hops for some targets is very high. 


\section{Architecture B}
\label{sec:archb}

\nameref{fig:architectureB}


\section{Architecture C}
\label{sec:archc}

\nameref{fig:architectureC}
