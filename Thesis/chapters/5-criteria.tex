\chapter{Deciding on the criteria}
\label{chp:criteria}

One of the most important asepcts of this thesis is the criteria used to evaluate the different architectures.

In order to find and calibrate a good criteria, a survey was conducted in which ten architectures were evaluated by security experts in the field of automotive security.
Their rating and feedback on this "training set" was used to calibrate the criteria used on the main architectures in this thesis.
Doing a survey with such a set rather than the architectures themselves was done to avoid biasing the results, as well as have a well evaluated criteria.
In addition, the training set is much larger than the main set, thus the results are more accurate.

\section{Survey}
\label{sec:survey}

Security experts at Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation were given ten architectures as shown in \ref{chp:arch}
The experts were asked to rank the architectures and give reasoning behind their ranking, as well as add any comments they had.
