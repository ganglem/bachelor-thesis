\chapter{Conclusion}

Of course, there is room for improvement.
For exapmle, the security mechanisms implemented in the vehicle, such as firewalls or IDCs, were not considered in great detail, but just as the feasibility of each component.
A more fine granular analysis of each component would be beneficial. This way, you would have to consider more variables and thus get a more accurate result.
However, considering them in this thesis would have made it too complex and too long, and thus it was not done.
