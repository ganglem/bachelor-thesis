### [Cellular network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network)

A **cellular network** or **mobile network** is a [communication network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_network "Communication network") where the link to and from end nodes is [wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless "Wireless"). The network is distributed over land areas called "cells", each served by at least one fixed-location [transceiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transceiver "Transceiver") (typically three [cell sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site "Cell site") or [base transceiver stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_transceiver_station "Base transceiver station")). These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of content. A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell.

When joined together, these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. This enables numerous portable transceivers (e.g., [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone "Mobile phone"), [tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer "Tablet computer") and [laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop "Laptop") equipped with [mobile broadband modems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_broadband_modem "Mobile broadband modem"), [pagers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager "Pager"), etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission.

Cellular networks offer a number of desirable features:
-   More capacity than a single large transmitter, since the same frequency can be used for multiple links as long as they are in different cells
-   Mobile devices use less power than with a single transmitter or satellite since the cell towers are closer
-   Larger coverage area than a single terrestrial transmitter, since additional cell towers can be added indefinitely and are not limited by the horizon
-   Capability of utilizing higher frequency signals (and thus more available bandwidth / faster data rates) that are not able to propagate at long distances
-   With data compression and multiplexing, several video (including digital video) and audio channels may travel through a higher frequency signal on a single wideband carrier

Major telecommunications providers have deployed voice and data cellular networks over most of the inhabited land area of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"). This allows mobile phones and [mobile computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_computing "Mobile computing") devices to be connected to the [public switched telephone network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network "Public switched telephone network") and public [Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access "Internet access"). Private cellular networks can be used for research) or for large organizations and fleets, such as dispatch for local public safety agencies or a taxicab company.
