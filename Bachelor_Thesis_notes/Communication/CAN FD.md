### [CAN FD - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_FD)

**CAN FD** (Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate) is a [data-communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") used for broadcasting sensor data and control information on 2 wire interconnections between different parts of electronic [instrumentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation "Instrumentation") and control system. This protocol is used in modern high performance vehicles. CAN FD is an extension to the original [[CAN]] bus protocol that was specified in ISO 11898-1. The basic idea to overclock part of the frame and to oversize the payload dates back to 1999. Developed in 2011 and released in 2012 by [Bosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bosch_GmbH "Robert Bosch GmbH"), CAN FD was developed to meet the need to increase the data transfer rate up to 5 times faster and with larger frame/message sizes for use in modern automotive [[ECU]]s. As in the classic [[CAN]], CAN FD protocol is designed to reliably transmit and receive sensor data, control commands and to detect data errors between electronic sensor devices, controllers and [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller "Microcontroller"). Although CAN FD was primarily designed for use in high performance vehicle [[ECU]]s, the pervasiveness of classic [[CAN]] in the different industries will lead into inclusion of this improved data-communication protocol in a variety of other applications as well, such as in electronic systems used in robotics, defense, industrial automation, underwater vehicles, medical equipment, avionics, down-hole drilling sensors, etc.
