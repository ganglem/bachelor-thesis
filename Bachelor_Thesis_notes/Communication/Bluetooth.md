### [Bluetooth - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth)

**Bluetooth** is a short-range [wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless "Wireless") technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances and building [personal area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network "Personal area network") (PANs). It employs [UHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency "Ultra high frequency") [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave") in the [ISM bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band "ISM band"), from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz. It is mainly used as an alternative to wire connections, to exchange files between nearby portable devices and connect [cell phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_phone "Cell phone") and music players with [wireless headphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_headphone "Wireless headphone"). In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 2.5 [milliwatts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milliwatt "Milliwatt"), giving it a very short range of up to 10 metres (33 ft).

Bluetooth is managed by the [Bluetooth Special Interest Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Special_Interest_Group "Bluetooth Special Interest Group") (SIG), which has more than 35,000 member companies in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics. The [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers") standardized Bluetooth as **IEEE 802.15.1**, but no longer maintains the standard. The Bluetooth SIG oversees development of the specification, manages the qualification program, and protects the trademarks. A manufacturer must meet [Bluetooth SIG standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Special_Interest_Group#Qualification "Bluetooth Special Interest Group") to market it as a Bluetooth device. A network of [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent") apply to the technology, which are licensed to individual qualifying devices. As of 2009, Bluetooth [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") chips ship approximately 920 million units annually. By 2017, there were 3.6 billion Bluetooth devices being shipped annually and the shipments were expected to continue increasing at about 12% a year. In 2021, shipments reached 4.7 billion units, with 9% growth forecast
