#### [Vehicle-to-everything - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-to-everything)

**Vehicle-to-everything** (**V2X**) is communication between a [vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") and any entity that may affect, or may be affected by, the vehicle. It is a [vehicular communication system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_communication_systems "Vehicular communication systems") that incorporates other more specific types of communication as V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure), V2N (vehicle-to-network), V2V ([vehicle-to-vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_ad-hoc_network "Vehicular ad-hoc network")), V2P (vehicle-to-pedestrian), V2D ([vehicle-to-device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-to-device "Vehicle-to-device")).

The main motivations for V2X are [road safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_safety "Road safety"), [traffic efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_in_transport "Energy efficiency in transport"), [energy savings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_savings "Energy savings"), and [mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance "Mass surveillance"). The U.S. [NHTSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration") estimates a minimum of 13% reduction in traffic accidents if a V2V system were implemented, resulting in 439,000 fewer crashes per year. There are two types of V2X communication technology depending on the underlying technology being used: (1) [WLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN "Wireless LAN")-based, and (2) [cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network "Cellular network")-based.
