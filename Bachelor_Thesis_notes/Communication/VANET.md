### [Vehicular ad hoc network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_ad_hoc_network)

**Vehicular ad hoc networks** (**VANETs**) are created by applying the principles of [mobile ad hoc networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network "Mobile ad hoc network") (MANETs) – the spontaneous creation of a wireless network of mobile devices – to the domain of vehicles. VANETs were first mentioned and introduced in 2001 under "[car-to-car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_communication_systems "Vehicular communication systems") ad-hoc mobile communication and networking" applications, where networks can be formed and information can be relayed among cars. It was shown that vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communications architectures will co-exist in VANETs to provide [road safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_safety "Road safety"), navigation, and other roadside services. VANETs are a key part of the [intelligent transportation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_transportation_systems "Intelligent transportation systems") (ITS) framework. Sometimes, VANETs are referred as Intelligent Transportation Networks. They are understood as having evolved into a broader "[Internet of vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_vehicles "Internet of vehicles")".  which itself is expected to ultimately evolve into an "Internet of autonomous vehicles".

While, in the early 2000s, VANETs were seen as a mere one-to-one application of MANET principles, they have since then developed into a field of research in their own right. By 2015, the term VANET became mostly synonymous with the more generic term **inter-vehicle communication** (**IVC**), although the focus remains on the aspect of spontaneous networking, much less on the use of infrastructure like Road Side Units (RSUs) or cellular networks.
