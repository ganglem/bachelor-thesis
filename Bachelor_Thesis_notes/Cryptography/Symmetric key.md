### [Symmetric-key algorithm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm)

Symmetric-key algorithms are [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") for [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") that use the same [cryptographic keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography) "Key (cryptography)") for both the encryption of [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext") and the decryption of [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext "Ciphertext"). The keys may be identical, or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys. The keys, in practice, represent a [shared secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_secret "Shared secret") between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link. The requirement that both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks of symmetric-key encryption, in comparison to [public-key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_encryption "Public key encryption") (also known as asymmetric-key encryption). However, symmetric-key encryption algorithms are usually better for bulk encryption. They have a smaller key size, which means less storage space and faster transmission. Due to this, asymmetric-key encryption is often used to exchange the secret key for symmetric-key encryption
