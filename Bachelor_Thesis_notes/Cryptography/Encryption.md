### [Encryption - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption)

In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"), **encryption** is the process of [encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code "Code") information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext"), into an alternative form known as [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext "Ciphertext"). Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.

For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a [pseudo-random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-random "Pseudo-random") encryption [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography) "Key (cryptography)") generated by an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm"). It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.

Historically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography. Early encryption techniques were often used in military messaging. Since then, new techniques have emerged and become commonplace in all areas of modern computing. Modern encryption schemes use the concepts of [public-key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography "Public-key cryptography") and [symmetric-key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm "Symmetric-key algorithm") Modern encryption techniques ensure security because modern computers are inefficient at cracking the encryption.
