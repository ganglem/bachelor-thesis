### [Access control - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control)

In the fields of physical security and information security, **access control** (**AC**) is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource, while access management describes the process. The act of _accessing_ may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called _authorization_.

Locks and login credentials are two analogous mechanisms of access control.
