## ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level)

ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) is a classification system used in the automotive industry to describe the safety requirements and performance levels of automotive systems and components. The ASIL classification system is defined in the [[ISO 26262]] standard for functional safety in the automotive industry.

The ASIL classification system is based on a four-level hierarchy, with ASIL D representing the lowest level of safety and ASIL A representing the highest level of safety. Each ASIL level is associated with specific safety requirements and performance levels, and the appropriate ASIL level is determined based on the potential consequences of a safety failure in the system or component.

ASIL classifications are used to ensure that automotive systems and components are designed and tested to meet appropriate safety standards, and they are an important aspect of functional safety in the automotive industry. ASIL classifications are typically used in conjunction with other safety assessment methods, such as hazard and risk analysis, to ensure that the safety of automotive systems and components is adequately addressed.
