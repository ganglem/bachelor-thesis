This chapter discusses the [[HEAVENS]] and EVITA frameworks, which perform risk assessments of general IT systems and models built specifically for automotive systems, respectively. HEAVENS framework uses both a threat level and impact level to calculate risk. Performing a risk assessment using the HEAVENS model consists of three steps: determining the threat level = likelihood; determining the impact level = impact; and determining the security level = final risk rating. EVITA framework considers the potential of attacks to impact the privacy of vehicle passengers, financial losses, and the operational capabilities of the vehicle's systems and functions. EVITA assumes the probability of a successful attack in every attack scenario defined to be 100 percent probable predicated on the potential of the attacker and the target of evaluation's capability to withstand the attack.

The objective of EVITA is to design, verify, and prototype an architecture for automotive on-board networks where security-relevant components are protected against tampering and sensitive data are protected against compromise.
