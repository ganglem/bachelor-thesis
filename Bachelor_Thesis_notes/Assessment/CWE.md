The **Common Weakness Enumeration** (CWE) is a category system for hardware and software weaknesses and vulnerabilities. It is sustained by a community project with the goals of understanding flaws in software and hardware and creating automated tools that can be used to identify, fix, and prevent those flaws. The project is sponsored by the [National Cybersecurity FFRDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cybersecurity_FFRDC), which is operated by [The MITRE Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitre_Corporation "Mitre Corporation"), with support from [US-CERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-CERT "US-CERT") and the [National Cyber Security Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Division "National Cyber Security Division") of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
