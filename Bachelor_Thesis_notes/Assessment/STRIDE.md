**STRIDE** is a model for identifying [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security") [threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_(computer) "Threat (computer)") developed by Praerit Garg and [Loren Kohnfelder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loren_Kohnfelder "Loren Kohnfelder") at [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"). It provides a [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic") for security threats in six categories.

The threats are:

-   [**S**poofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack "Spoofing attack")
-   [**T**ampering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampering_(crime) "Tampering (crime)")
-   [**R**epudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation "Non-repudiation")
-   **I**nformation disclosure ([privacy breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_privacy "Data privacy") or [data leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_leak "Data leak"))
-   [**D**enial of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack")
-   [**E**levation of privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation "Privilege escalation") [[Access Control]]

The STRIDE was initially created as part of the process of [threat modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_modeling "Threat modeling"). STRIDE is a model of threats, used to help reason and find threats to a system. It is used in conjunction with a model of the target system that can be constructed in parallel. This includes a full breakdown of processes, data stores, data flows, and trust boundaries.

Today it is often used by security experts to help answer the question "what can go wrong in this system we're working on?"
