**System under test** (**SUT**) refers to a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system "Software system") that is being tested for correct operation. According to [ISTQB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTQB "ISTQB") it is the test object. From a Unit Testing perspective, the SUT represents all of the classes in a test that are not predefined pieces of code like stubs or even mocks. Each one of this can have its own configuration (a name and a version), making it scalable for a series of tests to get more and more precise, according to the quantity of quality of the system in test.
