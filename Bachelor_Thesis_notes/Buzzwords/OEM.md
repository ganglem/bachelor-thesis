#### [Original equipment manufacturer - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer)

An **original equipment manufacturer** (**OEM**) is generally perceived as a company that produces non-aftermarket parts and equipment that may be marketed by another manufacturer. It is a common industry term recognized and used by many professional organizations such as [SAE International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_International "SAE International")and others.

However, the term is also used in several other ways, which causes [ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity "Ambiguity"). It sometimes means the maker of a system that includes other companies' subsystems, an end-product producer, an automotive part that is manufactured by the same company that produced the original part used in the automobile's assembly, or a [value-added reseller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_reseller "Value-added reseller").
