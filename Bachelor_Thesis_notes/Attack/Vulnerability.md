### [Vulnerability (computing) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing))

**Vulnerabilities** are flaws in a computer system that weaken the overall security of the device/system. Vulnerabilities can be weaknesses in either the hardware itself, or the software that runs on the hardware. Vulnerabilities can be [exploited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security) "Exploit (computer security)") by a [threat actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_actor "Threat actor"), such as an attacker, to cross privilege boundaries (i.e. perform unauthorized actions) within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerabilities are also known as the [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface "Attack surface").

[Vulnerability management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_management "Vulnerability management") is a cyclical practice that varies in theory but contains common processes which include: discover all assets, prioritize assets, assess or perform a complete vulnerability scan, report on results, remediate vulnerabilities, verify remediation - repeat. This practice generally refers to software vulnerabilities in computing systems. Agile vulnerability management refers preventing attacks by identifying all vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.

A security risk is often incorrectly classified as a vulnerability. The use of vulnerability with the same meaning of risk can lead to confusion. The risk is the potential of a significant impact resulting from the exploit of a vulnerability. Then there are vulnerabilities without risk: for example when the affected [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_(computing) "Asset (computing)") has no value. A vulnerability with one or more known instances of working and fully implemented attacks is classified as an exploitable vulnerability—a vulnerability for which an [exploit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security) "Exploit (computer security)") exists. The window of vulnerability is the time from when the security hole was introduced or manifested in deployed software, to when access was removed, a security fix was available/deployed, or the attacker was disabled—see [zero-day attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_attack "Zero-day attack").

[Security bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_bug "Security bug") ([security defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware#Security_defect "Malware")) is a narrower concept. There are vulnerabilities that are not related to software: [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware"), site, personnel vulnerabilities are examples of vulnerabilities that are not software security bugs.

Constructs in [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language "Computer language") that are difficult to use properly can manifest large numbers of vulnerabilities.


#### Classification

Vulnerabilities are classified according to the asset class they are related to:

-   hardware
    -   susceptibility to humidity or dust
    -   susceptibility to unprotected storage
    -   age-based wear that causes failure
    -   over-heating
-   software
    -   insufficient testing
    -   insecure coding
    -   lack of [audit trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_trail "Audit trail")
    -   design flaw
-   network
    -   unprotected communication lines (e.g. lack of [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"))
    -   insecure [network architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_architecture "Network architecture")
-   personnel
    -   inadequate recruiting process
    -   inadequate [security awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_awareness "Security awareness")
    -   insider threat
-   physical site
    -   area subject to natural disasters (e.g. flood, earthquake)
    -   interruption of power source
-   organizational
    -   lack of regular audits
    -   lack of continuity plans
    -   lack of security


#### Causes

-   Complexity: Large, complex systems increase the probability of flaws and unintended [access points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions "File system permissions").
-   Familiarity: Using common, well-known code, software, operating systems, and/or hardware increases the probability an attacker has or can find the knowledge and tools to exploit the flaw.
-   Connectivity: More physical connections, privileges, ports, protocols, and services and time each of those are accessible increase vulnerability.
-   Password management flaws: The computer user uses [weak passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength "Password strength") that could be discovered by brute force. The computer user stores the password on the computer where a program can access it. Users re-use passwords between many programs and websites.
-   Fundamental [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") design flaws: The operating system designer chooses to enforce suboptimal policies on user/program management. For example, operating systems with policies such as [default permit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_permit "Default permit") grant every program and every user full access to the entire computer. This operating system flaw allows viruses and malware to execute commands on behalf of the administrator.
-   Internet Website Browsing: Some internet websites may contain harmful [Spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware "Spyware") or [Adware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adware "Adware") that can be installed automatically on the computer systems. After visiting those websites, the computer systems become infected and personal information will be collected and passed on to third party individuals.
-   [Software bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug "Software bug"): The programmer leaves an exploitable bug in a software program. The software bug may allow an attacker to misuse an application.
-   [Unchecked user input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unchecked_user_input "Unchecked user input"): The program assumes that all user input is safe. Programs that do not check user input can allow unintended direct execution of commands or SQL statements (known as [Buffer overflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow "Buffer overflow"), [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection "SQL injection") or other non-validated inputs).
-   Not learning from past mistakes: for example most vulnerabilities discovered in [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4") protocol software were discovered in the new [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6 "IPv6") implementations.

The research has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user, operator, designer, or other human: so humans should be considered in their different roles as asset, threat, information resources. [Social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security) "Social engineering (security)") is an increasing security concern.

### Consequences

The impact of a security breach can be very high. Most legislation sees the failure of IT managers to address IT systems and applications vulnerabilities if they are known to them as misconduct; IT managers have a responsibility to manage [IT risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_risk "IT risk"). [Privacy law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law "Privacy law") forces managers to act to reduce the impact or likelihood of that security risk. [Information technology security audit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_security_audit "Information technology security audit") is a way to let other independent people certify that the IT environment is managed properly and lessen the responsibilities, at least having demonstrated the good faith. [Penetration test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test "Penetration test") is a form of verification of the weakness and countermeasures adopted by an organization: a [White hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security) "White hat (computer security)") hacker tries to attack an organization's information technology assets, to find out how easy or difficult it is to compromise the IT security. The proper way to professionally manage the IT risk is to adopt an Information Security Management System, such as [ISO/IEC 27002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27002 "ISO/IEC 27002") or [Risk IT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_IT "Risk IT") and follow them, according to the security strategy set forth by the upper management.
One of the key concept of information security is the principle of [defence in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth "Defence in depth"), i.e. to set up a multilayer defense system that can:
-   prevent the exploit
-   detect and intercept the attack
-   find out the threat agents and prosecute them

[Intrusion detection system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system "Intrusion detection system") is an example of a class of systems used to detect [attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_(computing) "Attack (computing)").

[Physical security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_security "Physical security") is a set of measures to physically protect an information asset: if somebody can get physical access to the information asset, it is widely accepted that an attacker can access any information on it or make the resource unavailable to its legitimate users.

Some sets of criteria to be satisfied by a computer, its operating system and applications in order to meet a good security level have been developed: [ITSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITSEC "ITSEC") and [Common criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_criteria "Common criteria") are two examples.
