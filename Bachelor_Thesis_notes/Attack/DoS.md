#### [Denial-of-service attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), a **denial-of-service attack** (**DoS attack**) is a [cyber-attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-attack "Cyber-attack") in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended [users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing) "User (computing)") by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service "Network service") of a [host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network) "Host (network)") connected to a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"). Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

In a **distributed denial-of-service attack** (**DDoS attack**), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. More sophisticated strategies are required to mitigate this type of attack, as simply attempting to block a single source is insufficient because there are multiple sources.

A DoS or DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, thus disrupting trade.

Criminal perpetrators of DoS attacks often target sites or services hosted on high-profile [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server") such as banks or [credit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card) [payment gateways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway "Payment gateway"). [Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge "Revenge"), [blackmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail "Blackmail") and [hacktivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacktivism "Hacktivism")can motivate these attacks.
