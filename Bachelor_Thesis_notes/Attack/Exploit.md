#### [Exploit (computer security) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security))

An **exploit** (from the English verb _to exploit_, meaning "to use something to one’s own advantage") is a piece of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software"), a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug "Software bug") or [vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computer_science) "Vulnerability (computer science)") to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing [privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation "Privilege escalation"), or a [denial-of-service (DoS or related DDoS) attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack"). In lay terms, some exploit is akin to a 'hack'.
