### [ISO - ISO/SAE 21434:2021 - Road vehicles — Cybersecurity engineering](https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html)

This document specifies engineering requirements for cybersecurity risk management regarding concept, product development, production, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of electrical and electronic [[E - E Architecture]] systems in road vehicles, including their components and interfaces.

A framework is defined that includes requirements for cybersecurity processes and a common language for communicating and managing cybersecurity risk.

This document is applicable to series production road vehicle E/E systems, including their components and interfaces, whose development or modification began after the publication of this document.

This document does not prescribe specific technology or solutions related to cybersecurity.


### Purpose of this document

This document addresses the cybersecurity perspective in engineering of electrical and electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles. By ensuring appropriate consideration of cybersecurity, this document aims to enable the engineering of E/E systems to keep up with state-of-the-art technology and evolving attack methods.

This document provides vocabulary, objectives, requirements and guidelines related to cybersecurity engineering as a foundation for common understanding throughout the supply chain. This enables organizations to:

-   define cybersecurity policies and processes;
-   manage cybersecurity risk; and
-   foster a cybersecurity culture.

This document can be used to implement a cybersecurity management system including cybersecurity risk management.
