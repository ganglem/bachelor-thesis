### [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System)

The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System** (**CVSS**) is a free and [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard "Open standard") [industry standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard "Technical standard") for assessing the severity of [computer system security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security") [vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing) "Vulnerability (computing)"). CVSS attempts to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, allowing responders to prioritize responses and resources according to threat. Scores are calculated based on a formula that depends on several [metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_metric "Software metric") that approximate ease and impact of an exploit. Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe. While many utilize only the CVSS Base score for determining severity, temporal and environmental scores also exist, to factor in availability of mitigations and how widespread vulnerable systems are within an organization, respectively.

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a method used to supply a qualitative measure of severity. CVSS is not a measure of risk. CVSS consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modified by scoring the Temporal and Environmental metrics. A CVSS score is also represented as a vector string, a compressed textual representation of the values used to derive the score. Thus, CVSS is well suited as a standard measurement system for industries, organizations, and governments that need accurate and consistent vulnerability severity scores. Two common uses of CVSS are calculating the severity of vulnerabilities discovered on one's systems and as a factor in prioritization of vulnerability remediation activities. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides CVSS scores for almost all known vulnerabilities.  
  
The NVD supports both Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v2.0 and v3.X standards. The NVD provides CVSS 'base scores' which represent the innate characteristics of each vulnerability. The NVD does not currently provide 'temporal scores' (metrics that change over time due to events external to the vulnerability) or 'environmental scores' (scores customized to reflect the impact of the vulnerability on your organization). However, the NVD does supply a CVSS calculator for both CVSS v2 and v3 to allow you to add temporal and environmental score data.  
  
CVSS is owned and managed by FIRST.Org, Inc. (FIRST), a US-based non-profit organization, whose mission is to help computer security incident response teams across the world
