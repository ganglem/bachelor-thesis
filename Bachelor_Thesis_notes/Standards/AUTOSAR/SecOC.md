The SecOC module aims for resource-efficient and practicable authentication mechanisms for critical data on the level of PDUs. The authentication mechanisms shall be seamlessly integrated with the current [[AUTOSAR]] communication systems. The impact with respect to resource consumption should be as small as possible in order to allow protection as add-on for legacy systems. The specification is based on the assumption that mainly symmetric authentication approaches with message authentication codes (MACs) are used. They achieve the same level of security with much smaller keys than asymmetric approaches and can be implemented compactly and efficiently in software and in hardware. However, the specification provides the necessary level of abstraction so that both, symmetric approaches as well as asymmetric authentication approaches can be used
