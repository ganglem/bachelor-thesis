## Abstract

Based on the [[Model-Based Security Testing of Vehicle Networks]] approach with [[EFSM]] as a foundation, a database containing successful vehicular penetration tests is proposed to faciliate and **automate** [[Penetration Testing]] by generating [[Attack Path]]s


## Introduction

### Problem
- [[Security Testing]] is carried out in late stages of development
- [[Penetration Testing]] is carried out manually, experience-based, explorative
	- considered difficult to automate
- Due to high complexity of modern vehicles this appraoch is not feasible 
	
### Solution
- [[Model-Based Security Testing]] 
- automate [[Penetration Testing]] with the help of a database containing successful [[Penetration Testing]]
- [[Attack Path]]s are automatically generated

## Discussion

- this appraoch is similar to [[TARA]] and can be coupled with it
