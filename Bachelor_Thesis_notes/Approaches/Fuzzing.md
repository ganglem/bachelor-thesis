#### [Fuzzing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)

In [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming") and [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development"), **fuzzing** or **fuzz testing** is an automated [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing") technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or [random data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_data "Random data") as inputs to a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program"). The program is then monitored for exceptions such as [crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_(computing) "Crash (computing)"), failing built-in code [assertions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development) "Assertion (software development)"), or potential [memory leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak "Memory leak"). Typically, fuzzers are used to test programs that take structured inputs. This structure is specified, e.g., in a [file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format "File format") or [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") and distinguishes valid from invalid input. An effective fuzzer generates semi-valid inputs that are "valid enough" in that they are not directly rejected by the parser, but do create unexpected behaviors deeper in the program and are "invalid enough" to expose [corner cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case "Corner case") that have not been properly dealt with.

For the purpose of security, input that crosses a [trust boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_boundary "Trust boundary") is often the most useful. For example, it is more important to fuzz code that handles the upload of a file by any user than it is to fuzz the code that parses a configuration file that is accessible only to a privileged user.
