MBST combines aspects of [[Security Testing]] with model-based methods.

Attacks and their descriptions are an important factor in security testing.
This is why MBST aims to describe a system in a **formal way** to generte security attacks automatically for test execution.

- enable security tests early on in the process in an automated way
	- Vulnerabilites are identified and eliminated at an early stage
- [[SUT]]s are extended by security-specific aspects

- [[CSP]]
