MBST combines aspects of security testing with model-based methods.

Security testing in general verifies that security mechanisms have been implemented correctly and in particular detects [[Vulnerability]] in a system.
This is usually achieved through test methods such as [[Penetration Testing]].

Attacks and their descriptions are an important factor in security testing.
This is why MBST aims to describe a system in a **formal way** to generte security attacks automatically for test execution.
