### [Black-box testing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing)

**Black-box testing** is a method of [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing") that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing: [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_test "Unit test"), [integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing "Integration testing"), [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_testing "System testing") and [acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test "Acceptance test"). It is sometimes referred to as specification-based testing.
