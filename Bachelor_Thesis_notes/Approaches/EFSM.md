#### [Extended finite-state machine - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_finite-state_machine))

In a conventional [finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine "Finite state machine"), the transition is associated with a set of input [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic "Boolean logic")conditions and a set of output Boolean functions. In an **extended finite state machine (EFSM) model**, the transition can be expressed by an “[if statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_statement)” consisting of a set of [trigger conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trigger_condition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Trigger condition (page does not exist)"). If trigger conditions are all satisfied, the transition is fired, bringing the machine from the current state to the next state and performing the specified [data operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_operation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Data operation (page does not exist)"). 


*In this case, we are looking at an EFSM as described in: [[Model-Based Security Testing of Vehicle Networks]], [[Attack Path Generation Based on Attack and Penetration Testing Knowledge]]

- Model elements: [[Attacker Privileges]]
- Transitions: [[Vulnerability]]
	- enables the change from a source state to a target state
	- triggered when event occurs, guard condition must be met
	- state changes and action will be triggered
