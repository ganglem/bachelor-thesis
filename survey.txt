Hello everyone,

as most of you know I'm currently writing my bachelor thesis on the topic of
"Comparing different vehicle network architectures based on attack path analysis".
I'm currently working on the part of the thesis where I have to calibrate the criteria to evaluate the architectures.

In order to do so, I would like to conduct a survey.
You will be asked to rank the architectures based on their security regarding possible attack paths.

You will find different architectures attatched to this email.
Please rank them from 1 to 7 (1st being most secure, 7th being least secure).
If you can, please include why you ranked the architectures the way you did.
Feel free to add any comments you might have and to ask any questions you might have.

Please send your evaluation back to me by March 31st.

Thank you very much for your help!


Best regards,
Emilija
