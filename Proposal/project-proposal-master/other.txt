\item NIST SP 800-53 is a set of security controls and guidelines published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that provide a comprehensive framework for securing information systems and organizations. 
The security controls in NIST SP 800-53 are organized into families, such as access control, incident response, and system and communications protection. 
Each control has a specific objective, such as protecting against unauthorized access or ensuring information confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 
The standard also includes guidelines for implementing and assessing the security controls and maintaining and updating them over time.
The NIST SP 800-53 security controls are designed to be flexible and adaptable to specific needs, and they can be used in conjunction with other standards, guidelines, and best practices.
In the context of the automotive industry, NIST SP 800-53 can be used in combination with other standards mentioned above. \cite{nist}.
