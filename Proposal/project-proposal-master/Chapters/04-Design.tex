The tool will do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item take an ARXML file as input and parse it
	\item have the opportunity to change ECU and bus rating
	\item use an algorithm (potentially as mentioned in \cite{threat_surf}) to calculate the most feasible attack path from each entry vector to each target vector
	\item output the results to a table
	\item evaluate the table results, thus the vehicle architecture, based on a given criteria (not yet determined)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hardware Requirements and Required Purchases}
\label{chp:hardware-purchases}

Required hardware and software to for the project include but are not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a virtual machine with a Linux distribution (distribution not yet specified)
	\item Python (version not yet specified)
	\item appropriate libraries for the tool
	\item an IDE like PyCharm (recommended) or a text editor to change the script
	\item a Git repository where the code and thesis will be stored
\end{itemize}
