The increasing reliance of modern vehicles on technology and connectivity has made the cybersecurity of vehicular networks a critical research field. Ensuring the security of connected vehicles is crucial to the success of the emerging world of connected and autonomous transportation. The internal vehicular network architecture plays a crucial role in the overall cybersecurity of a modern vehicle\\

In this bachelor thesis, we propose a tool to automate the evaluation of the attack path feasibility of multiple vehicular network architectures. This tool would involve generating attack paths automatically, then evaluating the network's security based on the attack paths. Multiple different network architectures will be created and evaluated, and the results will be compared.
