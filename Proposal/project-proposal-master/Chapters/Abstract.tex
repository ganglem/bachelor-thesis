\chapter*{Abstract}\label{chp:abstract}

The increasing reliance of modern vehicles on technology and connectivity has made the cybersecurity of vehicular networks an important research field. 
Ensuring the security of connected vehicles is crucial to the success of the emerging world of connected and autonomous transportation. 
The internal vehicular network architecture plays a crucial role in the overall cybersecurity of a modern vehicle.\\

In this bachelor thesis, I propose the idea for a tool to automate the evaluation of the security of a vehicular network architecture. 
This tool would involve generating attack paths automatically, and then evaluating the security of the network based on the attack paths.
Multiple different network architectures will be created and evaluated, and the results will be compared to each other.
The goal of this project is to improve the overall security testing for 
Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation (MBTI) and to better identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities early on in the development process.
