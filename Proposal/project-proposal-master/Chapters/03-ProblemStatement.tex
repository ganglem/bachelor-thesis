\section{Project Type}\label{sec:type}

My bachelor thesis segues into the problems described in \ref{sec:field} by proposing the idea for a tool which can be used to automize the evaluation of the security of vehicular networks.
This bachelor thesis is done in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation.
To give this project a more scietific background, I will do the following: \\

I will conduct attack path analyses on different internal vehicle network architectures.
Those I will compare based on which provides more security with regard to attack paths.\\

First, I will be creating multiple different architecture diagrams, each with different topologies.
Second, I will write a script-based program, which automizes the evaluation of the different topologies.
Finally, I will decide on a criteria, e.g. ASIL, how to rate the different topologies and compare them with it.\\

The project will be both exploratory and implementory in nature, with a focus on the latter.
