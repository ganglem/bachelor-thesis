\section{Project Type}\label{sec:type}

My bachelor thesis segues into the problems described in \ref{sec:field} by proposing the idea of a tool that can be used to automate the evaluation of vehicular network security.
This bachelor thesis is done in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation.\\

I will conduct attack path analyses on different internal vehicle network architectures and then compare based on which provides more security regarding attack paths.\\

First, I will create multiple architecture diagrams with different topologies (A1 \ref{sec:a1}).\\
Second, I will write a script-based program, which automizes the evaluation of the different topologies 
(F1 \ref{sec:f1})
(F2 \ref{sec:f2})
(F3 \ref{sec:f3})
(F4 \ref{sec:f4})
(F5 \ref{sec:f5}).
Finally, I will decide on a criteria (A2 \ref{sec:a2}), how to rate the different topologies, and compare them to conclude which architecture offers the most security (A3 \ref{sec:a3}).\\

The thesis will be both exploratory and implementory in nature, with a focus on the latter.


\section{Thesis Questions}\label{sec:thesis-questions}

The main question of this thesis is:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item How secure is the given vehicular network architecture?
\end{itemize}

However, other questions might be, but are not limited to:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item What architectural approach makes a network safer than others?
    \item How do small changes in network positioning affect the network security overall?
    \item How do simple and more branched out networks compare in terms of security?
    \item How can different architectures be rated based on attack paths?
\end{itemize}
