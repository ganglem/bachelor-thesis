\section{Contingency Plans}
\label{sec:contingency}

The project is subject to change due to the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Due to other university assignments, I might not be able to follow the timeline as strictly as planned
    \item New insights gained during the projet might affect some aspects of tool implementation(\ref{chp:tool}), diagrams(\ref{sec:a1}), or thesis questions(\ref{sec:thesis-questions})
    \item Implementation problems, such as bugs or library incompatibilities, might arise while working on the tool
\end{itemize}
