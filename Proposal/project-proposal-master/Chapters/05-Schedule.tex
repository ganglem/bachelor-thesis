\section{Thesis Timeline}
\label{sec:gantt}

I was given 6 months to complete the bachelor thesis which gives 12 ECTs.
Due to contract complications, I had to sign up for the ... before starting the work on the project.

The coarse schedule looks as following and is subject to change:


\section{Contingency Plans}
\label{sec:contingency}

The project is subject to change due to the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Due to other university assignments, I might not be able to follow the timeline as strictly as planned
    \item New insights gained during the projet might affect some aspects of tool implementation(\ref{chp:tool}), diagrams(\ref{sec:a1}), or thesis questions(\ref{sec:thesis-questions}).
    \item Problems, such as bugs or library incompatibilities, might arise while working on the tool implementation.
\end{itemize}
