\section{Research field}\label{sec:field}

\begin{shaded}
\noindent
introduction into the coarse research field of the project \\
scope of this project: define what will be included and what not
\end{shaded}

This bachelor thesis is done in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation.\\
The company proposed the idea for a tool which can be used to automize the evaluation of the security of vehicular networks.
To give this project a more scietific background, I will do the following: \\

I will conduct attack path analyses on different internal vehicle network architectures.
Those I will compare based on which provides more security with regard to attack paths.\\

First, I will be creating multiple different architecture diagrams.\\
Second, I will write a program, which automizes the evaluation of the different topologies.\\
Finally, I will decide on a criteria how to rate the different topologies and compare them with it.\\

\section{Project Type}\label{sec:type}

\begin{shaded}
\noindent
type of the project. this may be implementation centric, exploratory/analytic or constructive/synthetic:

\subsection{implementation centric}
practical transfer of a theoretical concept, e. g. software

\bigskip
\subsection{exploratory/analytic}
define, categorize and evaluate an idea, concept or situation not addressed before in the same dimension as is proposed by this project
\subsubsection{example}
a new type of attack/exploit; transfer of a typical IT strategy to a new domain like automotive or embedded systems

\bigskip
\subsection {constructive/synthetic}
put together existing implementations of parts or concepts in a novel way or with an unexplored purpose
\subsubsection{example}
design and composition of a laboratory environment

\end{shaded}

\vfill

The bachelor thesis is both implementation centric as well as exploratory/analytic.\\

The main focus of the project will be to compare different internal vehicle network architectures based on which provides more security with regard to attack paths.\\

I will create ten different vehicular network architecture diagrams.\\
